# AdaptiveSampling
    Master Thesis in RTRT, applying spatial-temporal adaptive sampling in real-time. 
    
### Credit:

DXR12 Framework based on https://github.com/jpvanoosten/LearningDirectX12 but modified for compute
shaders and RTRT. 

### COMMENT:
Code is published as is, in its chaotic form, not designed ment to be presented. 
It can however work as a reference for future work who build on my thesis.
### Resources:
Some more scenes for testing can be seen in <LINK>. Mainly "Amazon Lumberyard Bistro",
"Sibenik Cathedral", and "Fireplace room".
